# Preface

Provinces, municipalities, districts and neighborhoods have their own unique
questions for their energy systems. ETLocal provides a way to get meaningful
insight into their current situation and allows to customize and create stable,
transparent present situations for usage inside of ETModel.

# Overview:

## In General

```
[ ETDataset ]-------------
                         |
[ ETSource ] ----------- |
                       | |
                       V V
[ ETlocal front-end ] <-> [ Machinery ] <-> [ ETModel ]
```

---

## Zoomed in:

**Front-end's schematic:**
```
[ ETlocal front-end ]* -> [ Transformer Gem ]** -> [ ETlocal turns it into a dataset ]
```

**Connection ETEngine/ETModel**
```
-> [ Transformer Gem ] -> [ Interface for ETEngine ] -> [ ETModel ]
```

# Front-end

**The focus lies at the ETLocal front-end**

*Transformers*

- Got feedback on the Transformer gem from Anthony
  - Need to implement those changes

*Front-end*

- General tab

# Little demo

(Please don't start ranting, *I'm not writing it down*. 21st of December is a meeting
where you can start dissing this front-end).

---

# Next sprint:

## Before 24 December:

*Transformer gem*
- ! Fixing feedback for the Transformer gem (1 day total, 0.5 day Gerard, 0.5 day Anthony)

__(No Transformer, no ETlocal front-end)__

*Front-end*
- Transport sector (without advanced options) (1 day max Gerard)
- Agriculture sector (without advanced options) (0.5 day max Gerard)
- Supply sector (without advanced options) (0.5 day max Gerard Westerhof)
- Asking feedback for next sprint (1.5 hour meeting Joris, Michiel, Gerard)
- Fixing obvious feedback (1 day Gerard)

*Nice to have*

- Change the attribute names (Michiel, 1 day max)

**Future gazing**

- How to make and keep a dataset stable?
  - What does that imply? In other words: what is 'stable'?
  - How to connect ETEngine to such a dataset?

---
# Next sprints (in order of priority)

- Improving front-end ETLocal
- Connecting ETLocal &rarr; ETengine
- Extracting functionality of the Excel
- Include a form of moderating
- ?
