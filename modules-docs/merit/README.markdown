## Introduction

The merit order module calculates the hourly electricity mix based on the demand for electricity and the installed capacities and marginal costs of the electricity producing technologies (called producers from now on). The two main results of this calculation are the full load hours for these producers and the amount of excess electricity that is used by the different flexibility technologies. More on these flexibility options can be found in [the main document on flexibility](../../general/flexibility.md).

The full load hours are used in the ETM for the scenario in the 'future' year, impacting, among others, CO2 emissions, costs, import&export, total energy use and renewable percentages of electricity and energy. In addition, the module calculates financial metrics for producers such as profit and profitability (defined below). The term 'merit order' refers to the order in which dispatchable plants (which will be defined below) are used to fill up the demand for electricity. This order is based on the marginal costs (in units of 'euro per MWh of produced electricity') of these plants, which are essentially the costs of producing an extra unit of electricity.  The Merit Order module is available in the professional version of the ETM in the Cost > Merit Order slide shown in Figure 1.
