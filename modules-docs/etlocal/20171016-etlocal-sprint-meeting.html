# ETLocal
## Sprint meeting

---

# Agenda

0. Preface
1. Overview
2. Initializer methods
3. Next sprint
4. The ETLocal process

---

# Preface

Provinces, municipalities, districts and neighborhoods have their own unique
questions for their energy systems. ETLocal provides a way to get meaningful
insight into their current situation and allows to customize and create stable,
transparent present situations for usage inside of ETModel.

---

# Overview:

```
[ ETDataset ]-------------
                         |
[ ETSource ] ----------- |
                       | |
                       V V
[ Front-end ] <-> [ Machinery ] <-> [ ETEngine ]
```

Dependencies: the front-end, the chaining to ETModel and even the documentation
(Groningen ten Boer) is currently leaning on the machinery.

---

# Machinery

```
[ Interface for ETEngine ] <-> [ Dataset ] <-> [ Input from ETLocal ]
```

*Problem:*
- Both the interface for ETEngine and the input for ETlocal are 'fluid'.
- The interface for ETEngine is being 'solidified' i.e. set in stone.

---

# Initializer methods (1/3)

Overview (projects that are affected):

- Atlas
- ETSource
- ETEngine
- ETModel

---

# Initializer methods (2/3)

Status:

- Atlas (<span style="color:green;">✔</span> / <span style="color:#bbbb00;">? (Prototyping)</span>)
- ETSource (<span style="color:green;">✔</span>)
- ETEngine (<span style="color:#bbbb00;">? (Prototyping)</span>)
- ETModel (<span style="color:green;">✔</span>) (Changes might be needed but are not significant)

Status: Prototyping ETEngine's implemenation

---

# Initializer methods (3/3)

- First version is roughly based upon the initializer inputs which carry some flaws:
  - Methods are run everytime a scenario is created
- @antw and me are looking into multiple options to improve this.
- The goal is to finish these methods in the coming two weeks.

---

# Next sprint:

- The implementation for initializer methods need to be crafted very carefully,
  since it will form the base for ETLocal.
  - Discussing multiple ideas, trying out the one's that seem promising
  - Implement that single method
