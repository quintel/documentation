# Agenda

0. Preface
1. Goal of this meeting
2. Ideas

---

# Preface

Provinces, municipalities, districts and neighborhoods have their own unique
questions for their energy systems. ETLocal provides a way to get meaningful
insight into their current situation and allows to customize and create stable,
transparent present situations for usage inside of ETModel.

---

# Goal of this meeting

- Find the priority of 'what is needed next?' in ETLocal
- Hear out possible other ideas

---

# Ideas:

- Moderating a local dataset
- Hooking up to the ETM front-end
  - Validation with Refinery
  - etc.
- Selecting custom areas (in other words: a non-CBS area)

---

# Moderating a local dataset

- Include ways for a user to 'freeze' a dataset / moderate incoming changes

---

# Hooking up the ETM front-end

- Connecting the input from ETLocal to ETEngine &rarr; ETModel

*Use-cases:*

- Trying out a dataset in the ETM
- Validating if a number gives the correct result in a scenario

---

# Selecting custom areas

- Making a dataset for a non-CBS area

*Use-cases*

- Make a dataset for a few houses
- Combining municipalities/neighborhoods/etc.
