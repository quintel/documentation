# To summarize

- Made it possible to run the analyses from the front-end
- Showing the results in a separate window
- Restructured the interface
- Created schematic of the households analysis

---

# What didn't we do?

**Dependency to analyses**
- Make each calculation apparent
- Giving an explanation to each initializer input

**Lack of time:**
- Try-out the dataset in a separate (ETM) environment
- Commit and use as stable dataset in ETM

---

# What are we going to do?

**Etlocal:**
- Focus on the analyses: households (2 days max), buildings (2 days), industry (rest):
  - Creating a schematic:
      - Re-evaluate the current ETLocal analysis
      - Translate the Excel analysis into ETLocal analysis
      - Agree upon schematic JB, CK, BS
  - Change the ETLocal analysis
  - Explain the calculation in the front-end

- Adding download/export dataset button (internal use)(1 day)

**non-ETlocal:**
- CSV dump of a scenario (1 day)
- I have 1 day off
