# Agenda

0. Preface
1. Current status
2. Decision
3. Next sprint - new features
4. Future sprints

---

# Preface

Provinces, municipalities, districts and neighborhoods have their own unique
questions for their energy systems. ETLocal provides a way to get meaningful
insight into their current situation and allows to customize and create stable,
transparent present situations for usage inside of ETModel.

# Current status

<a href"https://beta-local.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">https://beta-local.energytransitionmodel.com/</a>

---

# To summarize

**Initializer methods:**

- Tested and working (thanks Michiel)

**ETlocal front-end:**

- You can create a dataset with ETLocal
- Refinery validates before every change to guarantee stability
- With 66f we're exploring the possibilities to improve the front-end

---

# Next challenges

**1) One or many versions of a region?**

ETLocal is currently in a phase where a user can edit local datasets based of
The Netherlands; one of every province, municipality, district or neighborhood.
Everybody with an account can change it's values. This can be improved.

**2) Which attributes do we need to ask about a dataset?**

Another issue is that the values in the front-end of ETLocal are currently
unanswerable without the use of a secondary tool to calculate them.

---

# Decision:

ETLocal must support it's users to create a new dataset* for an existing
region.

_For example: A user wants to create his own version of Drenthe._


<p style="font-size: 12px">
  * A dataset in ETLocal is a collection of start values with a certain
  name-tag on it. With these values you can create an 'ETsource' dataset.
</p>

---

# What does this decision imply?

1. ETLocal must hold a set of default values which we can call 'The Quintel
default dataset'.
2. A user must be able to clone/fork these defaults into his own dataset.
3. A user must be able to set his dataset to public or private.
4. A dataset must belong to a user or group ('Quintel' being such a group).
5. Depending on the group you are in, you'll have different access levels to ETLocal.
6. A user must be able to destroy his own dataset.

---

# New features (1/4)

### ETLocal must hold a set of default values which we can call 'The Quintel default dataset'.

**Conditions:**

- Default users can view all *public* datasets and edit their own datasets.
- Quintel users can view/edit *all* datasets.

**Features:**

- Create 2 groups 'default' and 'quintel' (being respectively non-admin, admin) **(2 hours)**.
- Assign all current datasets to the 'Quintel' group **(2 hours)**
- Set permissions for user groups **(2 days)**

---

# New features (2/4)

### A user must be able to set his dataset to public or private.

**Conditions:**
- Every Quintel dataset is public
- Every cloned dataset is by default private, unless explicitly published by the user

**Features:**
- Add the possibility to switch between public/private for a dataset **(1 day)**.

---


# New features (3/4)

### A user must be able to clone/fork these defaults into his own dataset.

- Expand permissions for cloning **(2 hours)**
- A dataset must be copy-able, when public **(2 hours)**
- A dataset must also belong to a user (next to a group) **(2 hours)**

---

# New features (4/4)

### A user must be able to destroy his own dataset.

- A user must be able to destroy his forked dataset **(4 hours)**.

---

# Design (1/4)

### What a default user sees when opening a public dataset

---

# Design (3/4)

# Up next

The next sprints will be about:

1. Adding basic user authorization and the possibility to clone a dataset + discovering and discussing the possible transformations that are needed in order to come to a front-end which suits the needs of our users **(2 weeks)**
2. Improving the front-end further as specified with the points from sprint 1 **(? weeks)**
3. ...
4. ...
3. **-- MVP Done --**
4. ? **(2 weeks)**
5. ? **(2 weeks)**
