Every four weeks on a Thursday, the ETM is updated with the latest features and bug fixes. These changes
are on the **latest** version. Periodically, a **stable** version of the model
is released, freezing the then-current state. See the [Model versions](../main/user_manual/model-versions)
page for more details.
