		Every four weeks on a Thursday, the ETM is updated with the latest features and bug fixes. These
		changes are on the <strong>latest</strong> version. Periodically, a <strong>stable</strong> version of the model
		is released, freezing the then-current state. See the
		<a href="../main/user_manual/model-versions">model versions</a>
		page for more details.
