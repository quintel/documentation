title:  Industrial residual heat
---

There is a lot of heat available in industry that currently goes to waste. Using this residual heat as a source for heat networks could be an interesting way to reduce emissions. In the ETM you can re-use residual heat from the sectors below:

-   Chemical industry
-   Refineries
-   Fertilizer industry
-   ICT

The above sectors are chosen because of their high residual heat potential compared to other sectors and/or because these sectors are similarly modelled in the ETM.

You can choose which part of available heat you want to re-use in heat networks in the Supply > ['District Heating'](https://pro.energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/heat/heat-sources) section within the ETM.

## Determining available residual heat

### Chemical industry, refineries and fertilizer industry

The available residual heat from chemical industry, refineries and fertilizer industry is determined for each region based on the report [PotentiÃ«len, besparing, alternatieven (ECN, 2011)](https://publicaties.ecn.nl/ECN-E--11-058). In this report for different sectors the residual heat availability is depicted.

Several types of residual heat are distinguished in the report. Only two types are modelled within the ETM: heat from flue gasses and heat from processes.

### ICT

The potential of residual heat from data-centers is calculated with the same method that [Berenschot](https://www.berenschot.nl/actueel/2018/november/410-kton-CO<sub>2</sub>-besparing/) used determining the residual heat potential of Dutch data-centers.

## Modelling principals

Residual heat in the ETM originates from the useful demand nodes. The demand of the 'useful demand' nodes for each industry sub sector gives a good approximation of the available residual heat that currently goes 'unused'. This useful demand may change in the future, depending on you choices in a scenario regarding industry size, efficiencies etc. Based on the reports above the potential shares of residual heat was determined (the calculation can be found [here](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2108))
