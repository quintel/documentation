title: Datasets RES-regions
---

The RES dataset are a complete set which was compiled in the same way, based on the same data sources. Section 1 contains information about the method and sources.

For some regions a dataset was already available. Some of these datasets differ slightly from the RES dataset. in section 2 we explain the differences.

Please [contact us](https://quintel.com/contact) to discuss this more indepth or to see analyses of other parameters.

## 1. Sources used for datasets RES-regions

The datasets for all RES regions are compiled using the same sources and methods. This enables comparison between the regions. Most of the data is supplied by [Klimaatmonitor](https://klimaatmonitor.databank.nl). This data is supplemented with information from CBS. For some parameters regional informatio is not available. For example the split of electricity for households between various households appliances and lighting. We use national data for thoses parameters. [ETLocal](https://beta-local.energytransitionmodel.com/) provides more information about sources and method used.

## 2. Sum of RES regions vs Netherlands

The RES datasets are compiled by adding data for municipalities within the region. The sum of the RES regions should equal the NL dataset. However there are differences (see figure below).

Part of the differences can be explained by the difference in year the datasets are based on. The NL dataset is based on 2015, the RES datasets are based on 2016.

* **Final demand:** See figure and explanation below
* **Inhabitants:** No differences
* **Areable land:** [CBS data](c) is used for this parameter. In the national dataset non-cultural areable land is subtarcted from areable land. In the RES datasets all areable land is taken into account.
* **Wind:** Offshore wind is not part of the RES datasets, it is part of the NL dataset
* **Solar:** Most of the differences can be explained by the difference in year the datasets are based on. The NL dataset is based on 2015, the RES datasets are based on 2016. Source: [klimaatmonitor](https://klimaatmonitor.databank.nl/Jive?workspace_guid=3cb85006-aa69-4c0f-8cd8-688768e57511)

Most of the difference in final demand between the sum of the RES regions and the NL dataset can be attributed to the industry and energy sector. This data is incomplete on a regional level. We slightly overestimate demand for industry on regional level. Part of the difference is more technical. Losses for CHP's in industry are attributed to final demand on regional level and to primary demand on national level. Therefore, final demand on regional level is higher.

The difference for the transport sector is caused by the difference between 2015 and 2016. The final demand for transport was roughly 3% higher in 2016 than in 2015. Source: [Klimaatmonitor](https://klimaatmonitor.databank.nl/Jive?workspace_guid=3cb85006-aa69-4c0f-8cd8-688768e57511).
