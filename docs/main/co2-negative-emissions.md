title: Negative emissions
---
The ETM supports so-called 'negative' emissions. Negative emissions arise when more CO<sub>2</sub> is drawn from the ambient air than is added to it. In the ETM, there is two ways for negative emission to emerge:

* By applying carbon capture to power and hydrogen production plants using biomass. This is possible for:
  * Coal-fired power plants with biomass co-firing
  * Gas-fired power plants using green gas
  * Hydrogen production with biomass gasification technology
  * Hydrogen production with steam methane reforming using green gas

* By using Direct Air Capture

Below, both routes are explained in more detail.

## Negative emissions from biomass
Using biomass to extract bioenergy, for example for the production of electricity and hydrogen, and subsequently capturing and storing the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions released in this process may result in a net decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. This is typically referred to as BECCS: bio-energy with carbon capture and storage.

The reasoning behind BECCS is as follows: Biomass grows by drawing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. Extracting bioenergy from biomass releases this CO<sub>2</sub> again. However, when this CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and stored, CO<sub>2</sub> initially extracted from the atmosphere does not re-enter the atmosphere, leading to net decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.

The [IPCC](https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fgcbb.12514) estimates the global potential of negative emissions from BECCS between 0 to 22 gigatonnes per year.

## Negative emissions from Direct Air Capture
Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a process of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the ambient air using electricity. If the electricity used is renewable, storing the captured CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to a net decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The captured CO<sub>2</sub> can also be used for the production of carbon neutral fuels.

Direct Air Capture is a promising technology to bring down global CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere. However, it is also an energy intensive process. Since CO<sub>2</sub> in the ambient air is 'available' everywhere in the world, DAC capacity is likely to be installed in areas that will have very low (renewable) power costs.

## Bookkeeping
Negative emissions are incorporated in the CO<sub>2</sub> calculation in the following way:
* Negative emissions arising from the production of electricity or hydrogen are incorporated in the [emission factor](co2-emission-factors.md) of these carriers. Since the ETM allocates CO<sub>2</sub> to the sectors in which energy is _used_, this means that all sectors using electricity or hydrogen 'benefit' from these negative emissions. Using more electricity or hydrogen may result in lower or even net negative sector emissions.
* CO<sub>2</sub> captured by Direct Air Capture is deducted from the Energy sector.

The chart below shows an example of future net negative emissions in the households and buildings sector. This is achieved by large electrification in those sectors, combined with a power production mix that leads to a negative emission factor for electricity. The red target line shows the net total emissions in this scenario, which is the sum of all positive and negative sector emissions.
