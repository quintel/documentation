The [Energy Transition Model](https://energytransitionmodel.com/?locale=en) (ETM) is an open-source, interactive tool for energy modelling developed by Quintel. While other models focus on one or several parts of the energy system, the ETM allows you to build and explore scenarios for the entire energy system of your country, region or city. Years of data collection and updating make sure your scenarios generate fact-based conclusions creating important insights into the future of your energy system. In this way the ETM supports a successful energy transition!
