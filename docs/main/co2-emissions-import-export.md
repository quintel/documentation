## Introduction
In the ETM, various carriers can be imported from outside the area of your interest. For electricity, (collective) heat and hydrogen, there are no domestic on-the-spot CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: these carriers are produced elsewhere and hence CO<sub>2</sub> emissions resulting from this production also take place outside your area. One of the [main principles](co2-main-principles.md) of the ETM CO<sub>2</sub> calculation is that emissions are assigned to the location where energy is _used_, rather than _produced_. This means that, by default, the ETM _does_ take into account emissions of imported carriers.

The default emission factors for imported electricity, heat and hydrogen can be found in the [emission factor article](co2-emission-factors.md). In the model, the user can change these emission factors.

The sections below provide more background on the emissions of imported electricity.

## Imported electricity

The default setting for imported electricity depends on the chosen region and starting year. The user can change this default setting for both the present and future year in the ETM's [Flexibility â†’ Import/Export section](https://pro.energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/electricity_import_export/electricity-interconnectors). The tables below give some guidance in choosing an appropriate emission factor in your scenario.

### Country specific values

The European Environment Agency offers an overview of all European Union countries and their gCO<sub>2</sub> emission per kWh. On their website you can select a specific country and you can select the average of all the 28 European Union member states in from 1990 til 2014 ([EEA, 2018](#references)). Table 1 shows an overview of 2015 data.
