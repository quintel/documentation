If you have created a user account and are logged in you can save the scenarios you've created with a name and description. These scenarios can then be managed through the My Scenarios menu which can be accessed through the link at the top right of the page. Once clicked, you will see a menu with three different tabs: My Scenarios, My Transition Paths and Trash.

### 1. My Scenarios tab
The My Scenarios tab displays a list of your saved scenarios, including the region the scenario is describing and the last edited date. When hovering over a saved scenario three buttons will appear giving you the respective options to: 1.) Open the scenario to be further investigated and adjusted, 2.) Open the scenario in a transition path chart, and 3.) Move the scenario to the trash bin.

Clicking the title of one of your saved scenarios takes you to the Saved scenario management page.

#### 1.1 Saved scenario management page
The Saved scenario management page lets you change settings for your saved scenario, such as whether it is publicly visible or not, its name and description  and who has access to it:

- Changing the **Visibility** of your saved scenario is done by click the button with the eye logo, located to the right of the scenario title. By default this is set to 'Public', but can be changed to 'Private'. Setting your scenario to private means only you or other users you've given access to your scenario will be able to view the scenario.
- Clicking the **Settings** button, also located to the right of the scenario title, will show a menu with several options:
  - **Open energy mix infographic**: Opens a 'poster'-like page in a new tab displaying the highlights of your scenario's supply, demand and some statistics thereof.
  - **Edit title and description**: Allows you to change the title and description for your saved scenario.
  - **Manage access**: Allows you to manage which users have access to your saved scenario. When clicked takes you to the Saved scenario access management page (see next section).
  - **Move to Trash**: Moves the saved scenario to the trash bin.

#### 1.2 Saved scenario access management page
The Saved scenario access management page lets you manage which users have access to your scenarios and lets you set a role for those users. The page displays a table listing the current users having access to this scenario. Their access role for this scenario is listed after their name, and to the right of that the 'remove' button (trash can icon) can be found to remove to entirely remove the user from this scenario.

New users can be added by clicking the geen 'Invite user' button below the table containing the current users. Once clicked a pop-up window will open, containing a text field to enter a person's email address and the role that person should have in the scenario. The ETM will then send this person an email message notifying them with an invitation to collaborate on the scenario.

If the person does not have a user account for the ETM yet, they will have to create one first. Invited persons who have not yet accessed the scenario will be displayed with their email address and as 'pending' in the user table. Once they have viewed their Saved scenario list or the scenario they were invited to, the email address will be replaced with the user's name and the 'pending' label will disappear. From that moment a user's access role can be altered by clicking on it and then selecting a different role from the appearing drop-down box. Pending or not, a user can always be removed from a scenario.

The following roles are determined to manage the rights a user has on a given scenario:

- Viewer: Is able to view a saved scenario, but not able to make changes to it. The viewer is allowed to make a copy of the saved scenario however.
- Collaborator: Is able to view and make changes to the saved scenario, and make copies of it.
- Owner: Is able to makes changes to and copies of the scenario, and able to manage access to it.

### 2. My Transition Paths tab
The Transition Paths tab display a list of all your transition paths. Transition paths are charts where one of your saved scenarios is compared with up to four other scenarios. Major scenario characteristics are displayed in this chart, making it easy to compare how the scenarios differ, for example over time.

### 3. Trash
The Trash tab displays scenarios or transition paths that were previously dismissed and are no longer active.
