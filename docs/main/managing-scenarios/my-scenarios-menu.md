If you have created a user account and are logged in you can save the scenarios you've created with a name and description. These scenarios can then be managed through the My Scenarios menu which can be accessed through the link at the top right of the page. Once clicked, you will be directed to the my.energytransitionmodel.com page. On this page you have 3 tabs. 


### 1. Scenarios
The Scenarios tab displays a list of your saved scenarios, including the region the scenario is describing, the moment when the scenario was last edited, and the model version your scenario was created with. When clicking on a saved scenario three tabs will appear on the right:

- [Info](scenario-management) 
- [History](scenario-version-history)
- [Manage access](scenario-management)



### 2. Collections
The Collections tab displays a list of all your scenario collections. Collections consist of a group of scenario's. Within the collections tool, one can compare the scenario outcomes within one collection via the charts in the tool.
