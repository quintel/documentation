This page lets you change settings for a saved scenario, such as whether it is publicly visible or not, its name and description and who has access to it. The following actions can be taken:

- Changing the **visibility** of your saved scenario is done by click the button with the eye logo. By default this is set to 'Public', but can be changed to 'Private'. Setting your scenario to private means only you or other users that have acces to your scenario will be able to view the scenario.
- The **Edit** button will allow you the change the description and title of the scenario.
- The **Discard** button will move your scenario the thrash bin.
