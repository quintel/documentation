title: Manage access
---

The Saved scenario access management page lets you manage which users have access to your scenarios and lets you set a role for those users. The page displays a table listing the current users having access to this scenario. Their access role for this scenario is listed after their name, and to the right of that the 'remove' button (trash can icon) can be found to remove to entirely remove the user from this scenario.

New users can be added by clicking the geen 'Invite user' button below the table containing the current users. Once clicked a pop-up window will open, containing a text field to enter a person's email address and the role that person should have in the scenario. The ETM will then send this person an email message notifying them with an invitation to collaborate on the scenario.

If the person does not have a user account for the ETM yet, they will have to create one first. Invited persons who have not yet accessed the scenario will be displayed with their email address and as 'pending' in the user table. Once they have viewed their Saved scenario list or the scenario they were invited to, the email address will be replaced with the user's name and the 'pending' label will disappear. From that moment a user's access role can be altered by clicking on it and then selecting a different role from the appearing drop-down box. Pending or not, a user can always be removed from a scenario.

The following roles are determined to manage the rights a user has on a given scenario:

| Role | View | Copy | Change | Manage access |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Viewer | ✓  | ✓  |  |  |  
| Collaborator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓  |  
| Owner | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 

- Viewer: Is able to view a saved scenario, but not able to make changes to it. The viewer is allowed to make a copy of the saved scenario however.
- Collaborator: Is able to view and make changes to the saved scenario, and make copies of it.
- Owner: Is able to makes changes to and copies of the scenario, and able to manage access to it.

In addition to these three roles: A person that is not invited to the scenario can also view and copy the scenario if said scenario is set to public.
