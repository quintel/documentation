title: Manage access
---

This page lets you manage which users have access to your scenarios and allows you to set a role for those users. The page displays a table listing the current users having access to this scenario. Their access role for this scenario is listed after their name. 

### Adding or removing users
New users can be added by clicking the geen 'Invite others' button. Once clicked, a pop-up window will open containing a text field to enter a user's email address and the role that person should have in the scenario (also see [roles](#roles) below). The ETM will send this user an email message notifying them with an invitation to collaborate on the scenario. Note that if the person does not have a user account for the ETM yet, they will have to create one first. 

Invited users who have not yet accessed the scenario will be displayed with their email address and as 'pending' in the user table. Once they have viewed their saved scenarios or viewed the scenario they were invited to, the email address will be replaced with the user's name and the 'pending' label will disappear. From that moment a user's access role can be altered by clicking the drop-down menu displaying their current role and then selecting a different role. 

Pending or not, a user can always be removed from a scenario by clicking the 'remove' button (trash can icon) next to the user's name.

### Roles

The following table depicts the different roles a user can have and their corresponding access levels for viewing, copying, changing and managing a private scenario:

| Role (private scenario) | View | Copy | Change | Manage access |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| Viewer | ✓  | ✓  |  |  |  
| Collaborator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓  |  
| Owner | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 

- **Viewer**: Is able to view or copy a saved scenario, but is not able to make changes to it.
- **Collaborator**: Is able to view, copy and make changes to the saved scenario.
- **Owner**: Is able to view, copy, makes changes and manage access to a scenario.

When the owner sets the scenario to 'public', the scenario can be viewed by anyone who has a link to the scenario. 
The access levels are in case of public scenarios are similar to those of private scenarios, however the viewer in this case can either be invited or uninvited:

| Role (public scenario) | View | Copy | Change | Manage access |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| (Uninvited) Viewer | ✓  | ✓  |  |  |  
| Collaborator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓  |  
| Owner | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
