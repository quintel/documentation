title: Liquid fuels and feedstock
---

### Introduction

The ETM can model various processes for producing liquid fuels and feedstocks, ranging from conventional oil refining to advanced synthetic fuel production. These processes convert different types of feedstock (including crude oil, biomass, waste streams, hydrogen, and COâ‚‚) into transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks such as diesel, kerosene, methanol, and naphtha.

The model includes both established technologies like oil refineries and bio-ethanol fermentation, as well as emerging technologies such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrotreatment of vegetable oils (HVO), and various fuel-to-jet conversion processes. Each process has specific input requirements and output product distributions that affect the overall energy system.

This page provides an overview of the modelled liquid fuel production processes, their feedstock inputs, fuel outputs, and important modeling considerations.

### Overview of processes

| Proces | Feedstock input | Fuel output | Additional remarks|
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Oil refineries** | Crude oil | Diesel, gasoline, LPG, kerosene, heavy fuel oil (HFO), naphtha, other oil products, refinery gas | Output fractions based on refinery archetype if no refinery in start year |
| **Fischer-Tropsch** | Hydrogen, electricity, CO<sub>2</sub> | Kerosene (main product), naphtha |Exception: no diesel output (causes incalculable circularity in the model). Kerosene/naphta output increased proportionally.|
| | Non-biogenic waste | Kerosene (main product), diesel, naphtha | CO<sub>2</sub> emissions captured by default |
| | Biogenic waste | Biokerosene (main product), biodiesel, bionaphtha | CO<sub>2</sub> emissions captured by default|
| | Dry biomass | Biokerosene (main product), biodiesel, bionaphtha | CO<sub>2</sub> emissions captured by default|
| **Methanol synthesis** | Hydrogen, electricity, CO<sub>2</sub> | Methanol | - |
|  | Non-biogenic waste | Methanol | CO<sub>2</sub> emissions captured by default |
| | Biogenic waste | Biomethanol | CO<sub>2</sub> emissions captured by default|
| | Dry biomass | Biomethanol | CO<sub>2</sub> emissions captured by default|
| **Pyrolysis oil fractionation** | Pyrolysis oil (non-biogenic), hydrogen | Diesel, gasoline | - |
| **Pyrolysis bio-oil fractionation** | Pyrolysis bio-oil (biogenic), hydrogen | Biodiesel, bioethanol* | *Actual output is biogasoline but modeled as bioethanol|
| **Hydrotreatment to HVO (biokerosene)** | Oily biomass, hydrogen, network gas | Biokerosene (main product), bionaphtha | Other smaller output fractions not modeled; biokerosene/bionaphtha output increased proportionally instead |
| **Hydrotreatment to HVO (biodiesel)** | Oily biomass, hydrogen | Biodiesel (main product), bionaphtha | ther smaller output fractions not modeled; biokerosene/bionaphtha output increased proportionally instead |
| **Bio-ethanol fermentation** | Wet biomass, network gas | Bio-ethanol | output of DDG not modeled, but considered as loss |
| **Bio-ethanol-to-jet** | Bio-ethanol, hydrogen | Biokerosene (main product), biodiesel | Biogasoline also produced but not modeled; biokerosene & biodiesel fractions increased proportionally |
| **Methanol-to-jet** | Methanol, hydrogen | Kerosene (main product), gasoline | Light gases mixture by-product not modeled; kerosene & gasoline fractions increased proportionally |
| **Biomethanol-to-jet** | Biomethanol, hydrogen | Biokerosene (main product), bio-ethanol* | *Actual output is biogasoline but modeled as bioethanol; light gases by-product not modeled; kerosene & gasoline fractions increased proportionally |
