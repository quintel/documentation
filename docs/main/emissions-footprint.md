title: Greenhouse gas footprint
---

In the Results & Data > Visuals > [Greenhouse gas footprint](http://localhost:4000/scenario/data/data_visuals/greenhouse-gas-footprint) section you can find and download a summary of all emissions. 
The summary is based on the energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions calculated by the ETM and the energetic other greenhouse gas emissions or non-energetic emissions determined in the Emissions > [Greenhouse gases](energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview) section in the ETM. 
This page shortly explains what falls under the different categories in every graph.

## Overview Greenhouse gas emissions

| Category | Description | 
| ---- | ----|
|**Indirect & Delayed emissions**|_Indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are a product of the atmospheric oxidation of CH<sub>4</sub>, CO and NMVOC (Non-Methane Volatile organic compounds) which are mainly released in industrial processes but also in agriculture, households and a wide range of other sectors. Delayed emissions is captured CO<sub>2</sub> that has been emitted at a later point in time._|
|**Built environment**|_All emissions from the built environment shown in the seperate built environment graph._|
|**Transport & Mobility**|_All emissions from transport & mobility shown in the seperate transport & mobility graph._|
|**Industry & Energy**|_All emissions from industry & energy production shown in the seperate industry & energy graph._|
|**Agriculture**|_All emissions from agriculture shown in the seperate agriculture graph._|

## Built environment

| Category | Description | 
| ---- | ----|
|**Other emissions**|_Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions and energetic other GHG emissions._|
|**Appliances & lightning**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to lightning and appliances._|
|**Cooking**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cooking._|
|**Hotwater**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from hot water use._|
|**Heating & cooling**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from heating and cooling._|

## Industry & Energy

| Category | Description | 
| ---- | ----|
|**Other industry**|_All other (non)-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG from other sectors._|
|**Paper industry**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the paper industry._|
|**Food industry**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the food industry._|
|**Metal industry**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the metal industry._|
|**Energy sector**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions due to the production of heat and electricity._|
|**Waste management**|_Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions due to wastemanagement._|
|**Chemical industry**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions from the chemical industry._|

## Transport & Mobility

| Category | Description | 
| ---- | ----|
|**Other emissions**|_Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions and energetic other GHG emissions._|
|**Public transport**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from trams, trains and buses._|
|**Private transport**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from bicycles, motorcycles and cars._|
|**Freight transport**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from ships, freight trains and trucks._|
|**Domestic aviation**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from planes._|

## Agriculture

| Category | Description | 
| ---- | ----|
|**Soil cultivation**|_Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions from soil cultivation._|
|**Fermentation**|_Non-energetic other GHG emissions from (enteric) fermentation._|
|**Manure**|_Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions from manure from livestock._|
|**Energy use**|_Energetic CO<sub>2</sub> & other GHG emissions from lighting, heating, machinery and everything else._|
