title: Overview of costs per sector
---

Below you can find an overview per sector of the different costs taken into account by the ETM.

## Households
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Space heating & hot water technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Cooling technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Insulation | Investment costs
| Solar PV & solar thermal | Investment, O&M costs
| Appliances, cooking and lighting | Fuel costs

## Buildings
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Space heating technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Cooling technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Insulation | Investment costs
| Solar PV & solar thermal | Investment, O&M costs
| Appliances, lighting | Fuel costs

## Transport
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| All vehicles | Fuel costs
| Electric cars and hydrogen cars | (Optional) additional investment costs

## Agriculture
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Heating technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Appliances | Fuel costs

## Industry
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Heating technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Appliances | Fuel costs
| Feedstock | Fuel costs
| CCS | Cost per captured tonne CO<sub>2</sub>

## Flexibility
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| All flex technologies | Investment, O&M, fuel costs

## Energy Infrastructure
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Electricity | Investment, O&M costs per grid level (HV/MV/LV). Including off-shore grid, interconnection and transformers
| [District heating](heat-infrastructure-costs.md) | Investment, O&M costs. Distinction between indoor costs, primary and secondary distribution pipelines, exchanger stations and storage costs (per MWh stored)
| Hydrogen | Costs per transported MWh; storage costs per MWh stored
| Natural gas | Fixed amount of annualised infrastructure cost. This amount is area dependent but does not vary with gas demand in a scenario

## Energy production
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Electricity | For each installed power plant, the ETM takes into account investment, O&M and input fuel costs. For imports, a price (curve) can be set in the model. The electricity price per hour follows from the [Merit Order](merit-order.md) calculation
| Heat | For each heater, the ETM takes into account investment, O&M and input fuel costs. For imports, costs per GJ can be set in the model.
| Hydrogen | For each installed hydrogen plant, the ETM takes into account investment, O&M and input fuel costs. For imports, costs per MWh can be set in the model.
| Other carriers (natural gas, coal, oil, transport fuels, biomass etc.) | Costs per unit (MWh, barrel, tonne etc.) can be set in the model

## Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)
|  ***Subject***   | ***Cost components***  |
|---|---|
| Capture of CO<sub>2</sub> in industry | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Capture of CO<sub>2</sub> in energy sector | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Direct Air Capture of CO<sub>2</sub> | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| Utilisation of captured CO<sub>2</sub> (production of synthetic methanol and kerosene) | Investment, O&M, fuel costs
| CO<sub>2</sub> infrastructure | Investment, O&M for transportation via pipelines and ships
