When navigating to the Energy Transition Model, by default, you are directed to the **latest** version of the model. The latest version is generally updated on a monthly basis, making sure that the model has the latest features and bug fixes.

There are however also **stable** versions of the model. These versions are created by freezing the latest version at a given time. Stable versions are created much less frequently than the latest version of the model.

## Current versions available

Besides the **latest** version, there may be multiple **stable** versions available. Stable versions are labelled first with the year in which the version was released and then with a version number `#YEAR-NN`.

| Version | Release date | Updated | Link |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| #latest | - | Monthly | [energytransitionmodel.com](https://energytransitionmodel.com/) |
| #2025-01 | February 2025| - | [2025-01.energytransitionmodel.com](https://2025-01.energytransitionmodel.com/) |

## What functionalities do they offer?

The **latest** version is under continuous development. If you want the latest bug fixes, model features and charts, it is recommended to make scenarios on that version.

:::info Scenario migrations in the latest version
To make sure that scenarios keep working when the latest version of the model is updated, or to minimize changes in outputs, **scenario migrations** can be applied. This means that it is not guaranteed that inputs and outputs for scenarios on the latest version stay the same.
:::

The goal of **stable** versions is to have stable model input and outputs. If you want to use scenarios to report specific settings or outcomes of the model, it is recommended to make those scenarios on a stable version.

| Functionality | latest | stable |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Scenario management: updating, creating, deleting etc. | ✓ | ✓ |
| Scenario migrations | ✓ |   |
| Security improvements | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bug fixes | ✓ | * |
| New model features  | ✓ |   |
| Front-end changes: visual improvements, new charts etc. | ✓ |   |
| Dataset changes: new, updated, deleted datasets etc.  | ✓ |   |

:::info Bug fixes in stable versions
By default, bug fixes are not applied to stable versions of the model, as this may change inputs and outputs. Under very strict conditions, an exception can be made. Any stable version bug fix will be announced ahead of time. See [Communication about versions](#communication-about-versions).
