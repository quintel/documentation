title: Saved scenario info
---

This page lets you change settings for a saved scenario.

- **Public** / **Private**: this allows you to change the visibility of your scenario. When set to "Public", anyone with the link to your saved scenario can view it. When set to "Private", users need to be assigned the role "Viewer" for your scenario in order to view it (see also [Roles](scenario-manage-access#roles)). You can change the default privacy setting in Your Profile.
- **Edit**: this allows you to change the scenario title and description.
- **Discard**: this moves you scenario to the trash bin (see also [Trash](my-scenarios-menu#trash)).
