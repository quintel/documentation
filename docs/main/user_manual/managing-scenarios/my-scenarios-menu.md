title: My Scenarios menu
---

When you have created a user account and are logged in, you can save the scenarios you've created with a name and description. These scenarios can then be managed through the My Scenarios menu. The menu gives three tabs.

### Scenarios
The Scenarios tab displays a list of your saved scenarios, including the region the scenario is describing, the moment when the scenario was last edited, and the version your scenario was created in (see the [Model versions](../model-versions) page). When clicking on a saved scenario three tabs will appear on the right:

- [Info](scenario-info) 
- [History](scenario-history)
- [Manage access](scenario-manage-access)

### Collections
The Collections tab displays a list of all your scenario collections. Collections consist of a group of scenarios. Within the collections tool, one can compare the scenario outcomes within one collection via the charts in the tool. 

### Trash
The Trash tab displays scenarios or collections that have been deleted. You can recover or permamently delete these scenarios here. A scenario can be recovered until 60 days after deletion. After this period, the scenario will be permanently deleted.
