title: Supply
---

Within the [Supply](https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants) section you can try and cover the total energy demand which is set in the Demand section. The Supply section in the ETM covers the centralized production of both electricity and heat, as well as transport fuel. Decentralized production (e.g. of solar electricity) is covered in the Demand section. The following areas are covered:

-   Electricity
-	Renewable electricity
-	District heating
-	Hydrogen
-	Liquid fuels
-	Biomass
-	Fuel extraction

This page shortly explains the different categories present within the supply section.

## Electricity
You can influence the production of electricity by adjusting the amount of coal plants, gas plants, oil plants or nuclear plants.

## Renewable electricity
In the renewable electricity section you can adjust the amount of (centralized) solar power, wind power, hydro power, biomass plants, waste power, hydrogen plants or geothermal energy available in your scenario area. The maximum amount of available renewable sources for the creation of renewable electricity is not fixed in the ETM. This means you have to decide what is realistic for your specific scenario area.

## District heating
District heating can be used as heating technology in households, buildings and agriculture. There are roughly two types of heat sources: dispatchable and must-run heat sources. Dispatchable heat sources can be switched on/ off depending on the heat demand at that time, while must-run heat sources supply the heat network regardless of heat demand. For the second type in particular (seasonal) storage of heat is an interesting option.

_See the ['District heating'](https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/heat-networks/) section for more information._

## Hydrogen
In the hydrogen section you can specify how hydrogen is produced in the future. The ETM offers a wide array of production routes, both dispatchable or must-run. Excess hydrogen can be stored via the storage technologies. For more information checkout the [Hydrogen](hydrogen.md) section.

## Liquid fuels
The liquid fuels section allows you to model the production of transportation fuels and chemical feedstocks through various conversion processes. These include conventional oil refineries as well as advanced processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol synthesis, pyrolysis oil fractionation, hydrotreatment to HVO, and various fuel-to-jet conversion technologies. Each process converts different feedstocks—ranging from crude oil and biomass to hydrogen and CO₂—into products like diesel, kerosene, methanol, and naphtha. The model accounts for both biogenic and synthetic fuel production pathways, including CO₂ capture where applicable.

_See the ['Liquid fuels and feedstock'](liquid-fuels.md) section for more information._

## Biomass
In the biomass section you can choose how much biomass should be used as green gass in the gas network or production, or as bio-coal or -oil in energy plants. Furthermore, you can specify the total amount of biomass available in your scenario region by adjusting the sliders in the ‘potential of biomass’ section. Since biomass emissions are officially not considered in the EU you have the possibility to change this in the ‘CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of biomass’ section.

## Fuel extraction
Fuel extraction is supported by the extraction of energy carriers such as coal or natural gas (‘primary carriers’). These are converted to useful carriers such as electricity or heat. In the fuel extraction section it is possible to adjust the extraction of such energy carriers.
