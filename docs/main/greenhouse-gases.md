title: (Other) Greenhouse gas emissions
sidebar_label: Greenhouse gases
---

The ETM calculates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted as a result of energy use. Apart from CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there are also other non-energetic sources which lead to the emission of CO<sub>2</sub> as well as other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These ‘other emissions’ are separated into 3 groups within the ETM:

1. Other greenhouse gas emissions which are emitted as a result of energy use, such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)
2. CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of non-energetic activities, such as the use of raw materials in industry or the production of cement
3. Other greenhouse gas emissions from non-energetic activities, such as methane emissions from manure in agriculture

You can adjust these greenhouse gas emission in the Emissions > [Greenhouse gases](energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview) section in the ETM. This page further explains how these ‘other emissions’ are defined within the ETM. 

## Types of greenhouse gases 
Apart from CO<sub>2</sub> there are many other greenhouse gases (GHG) that are important to consider when trying to decelerate climate change. The following greenhouse gases were taken into account for the calculation of other greenhouse gases (GHG):
-	methane (CH<sub>4</sub>);
-	nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O);
-	hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs);
-	perfluorocarbons (PFCs);
-	suphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>); and
-	nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>)

These greenhouse gases play a role in all sliders under category 1. Energetic GHG emissions and category 3. Non-energetic GHG emissions. Greenhouse gases that were not taken into account include water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 

## Emission categories per slider
Every slider corresponds with a (set of) categories defined by the European Environment Agency (EEA). Categories that were not included within the calculation of emissions are ‘category 4. Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (‘LULUCF’)’ and ‘category 6. Other Sector’. All CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions from ‘Catgory 1. Energy’ as well as the production of fertilizer (ammonia) described in ‘category 2.B.1’ are calculated in the model using the emission factors. Therefore these categories are not included as a slider but rather a result of the choices you made regarding the energy system. These are shown in grey on top of these other emissions . Below you can find a table with all sliders and corresponding categories and explanation.
