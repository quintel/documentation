title: Costs (dashboard)
---

This page explains the six main groups that comprise the total annual costs displayed on your dashboard in the ETM. Also it shows the subgroups shown in the chart 'Detailed cost overview'. For more details on the scope see ['overview per sector'](https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/cost-overview-per-sector) and for more insight in the method (CAPEX + OPEX)see ['cost methods'](https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/cost-methods).

## Main cost groups:

1. **Buildings and installations:** Building and installation-related costs (CAPEX + OPEX) of sectors. Subgroups:
  -  Households  
  -  Buildings  
  -  Transport 
  -  Industry 
  -  Agriculture 

2. **Energy Production:** Installation-related costs (CAPEX + OPEX) of the energy production sector. Subgroups: 
  -  Power plants
  -  CHP plants (including the industrial steam network)
  -  Heat plants 
  -  Dedicated hydrogen production 
  -  Biomass treatment
  -  Other intallations (synthetic kerosine, regasification of lng, and energy compressors for network gas)

3. **Infrastructure**: CAPEX + OPEX of the energy infrastructure. Subgroups:
  -  Gas network (natural gas and green gas) 
  -  Heat network
  -  Hydrogen network
  -  Electricity network
   
4. **Storage and conversion:** Installation-related costs (CAPEX + OPEX). All G2P is associated with means of 'Energy production'. Subgroups:
  -  Power-to-power (p2p)
  -  Power-to-gas (p2g) 
  -  Power-to-heat (p2h)
  -  Storage (of hydrogen and heat) 

5. **Energy carriers and import:** All net primary demand of energy carriers. The carrier costs for export are is subtracted from the import costs. For example if gasoline (made in the country) is exported the neccessary imported crude oil costs are substracted from the total crude oil import. Export profits are not accounted for. 
  
6. **Carbon capture, sequestration and utilisation (CCSU):** CAPEX + OPEX of all CCUS technologies, including CO2 costs.
