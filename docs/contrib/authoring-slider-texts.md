## Overview

* **Goal** : slider information : Inform and direct to extra information.

* **Language**: British English / Dutch (ABN) with a preference for British English.
 
* **User Type**: Adult energy 'experts' or those aspiring to attain expertise in the subject matter. Focus on users already familiar with the topic. Avoid long explanations of the technique or trends, rather focus on what is meant by this technique (short definition) and how this technique is modelled (if relevant).
 
* **Tone**: Formal yet constructive and activating. Use active and concise sentences. Prioritize readability, avoiding unnecessary technical jargon, and aim to nudge users toward understanding and utilizing the ETM effectively.
 
* **Style**: Visual emphasis, utilize elements like arrows for brevity. Consistency in style to enable users to quickly scan and locate specific information.


## Recommended slider text Structure:
 
1. **What does this slider do?** (Max 20 Words):

   Clearly state the slider's purpose in a brief sentence.
 
   ***Example***:
   
    This slider adjusts the total installed capacity of autothermal reformers (ATR).

2. **How to set the slider at an appropriate value?**:

   Include any necessary warnings or additional information users should be aware of regarding the slider's effects or workings.
 
   ***Example***: 

   Note: ATR emits CO directly into the air, this meansâ€¦   
 
3. **Background** (50-100 Words):

   Provide concise background information about the associated technology or technique. Include a definition, usage, and, if relevant, advantages, disadvantages, or links to documentation.
 
   ***Example***: 

   ATR is a method for syngas/biofuel production, combining partial oxidation and steam methane reforming. It allows flexible hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratios for varied biofuel production. For more information, checkout the documentation [Documentation Link].
 
 
4. **Connections to Other elements** (1 Sentence or Bullet List):

   Clearly explain any connections to other sliders within the model, providing links or references.
 
    ***Example***: 

    Go to Emissions > CCUS > Capture of CO2 to install CO capture or the production of pure hydrogen production.
    Go to Costs & Efficiencies > Hydrogen > Hydrogen production for changing costs and efficiency.
