title: Guidelines for writing texts
---

The ETM has various locations where descriptions or announcements are written, such as slide and slider descriptions, documentation and the What's new page. The texts should be written in the same writing style and with the same tone. This page presents general guidelines for writing texts to ensure consistency in how texts are written. More specific guidelines are also available for writing [documentation](./authoring-docs.md) and [slider texts](./authoring-slider-texts.md), for which the general guidelines below serve as basis.

### Tone
Texts should be written with a formal yet constructive and activating tone. Use active and concise sentences. Readability should be prioritised and technical jargon avoided if possible. Users should be nudged toward understanding and utilising the ETM effectively. 

### Audience
The audience that reads the texts are adult energy experts or those aspiring to attain expertise in the subject matter. The focus is on users that are already (somewhat) familiar with the topic. 

### Format
The text format should be reader-friendly and should invite users to read or scan through at first glance. Avoid long stretches of text by making use of paragraphs separated by blank lines or by using bullets. Make use of **bold** text to indicate something important. Use links to refer to specific sections in the ETM or to the documentation. 

### Language
Texts are written in British English and (standard) Dutch.

### Reference style
Make use of hyperlinks when referring to specific slides in the ETM or to external pages. When referring to slides in the ETM, avoid using angle brackets (example: *Go to Demand > Industry > Steel*). Refer to the specific section by using a hyperlink instead (example: *Go to the [Industry](https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/industry/steel) section*). 

### To be avoided
Specific examples of what should be avoided in writing texts are:
* Saying “we” or "our" (the ETM is an “it”)
* Avoid addressing the user with “you” or "your"
* Questions (“What do you think will happen…?”)
