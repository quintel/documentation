title: Guidelines for writing texts
---

The ETM has various locations where descriptions or announcements are written, such as slide and slider descriptions, documentation and the What's new page. The texts should be written in the same writing style and with the same tone. This page presents general guidelines for writing texts to ensure consistency in how texts are written. More specific guidelines are also available for writing [documentation](./authoring-docs.md) and [slider texts](./authoring-slider-texts.md), for which the general guidelines below serve as basis.

## General guidelines

### Tone
Texts should be written with a formal yet constructive and activating tone. Use active and concise sentences. Readability should be prioritised and technical jargon avoided if possible. Users should be nudged toward understanding and utilising the ETM effectively. 

### Audience
The audience that reads the texts are adult energy experts or those aspiring to attain expertise in the subject matter. The focus is on users that are already (somewhat) familiar with the topic. 

### Format
The text format should be reader-friendly and should invite users to read or scan through at first glance. Avoid long stretches of text by making use of paragraphs separated by blank lines or by using bullets. Make use of **bold** text to indicate something important. Use links to refer to specific sections in the ETM or to the documentation. 

### Language
Texts are written in British English and (standard) Dutch.

### To be avoided
Specific examples of what should be avoided in writing texts are:
* Saying “we” or "our" (the ETM is an “it”)
* Avoid addressing the user with “you” or "your"
* Questions (“What do you think will happen…?”)

## Reference style
Depending on where text is written, the texts can refer to sections or charts in the ETM, to documentation pages or to the ETM Library (Refman). Hyperlinked texts should be used so that users can navigate to the specific sections. Below is explained how to refer to specific sections or pages:
* Slides in the ETM: the text that contains the hyperlink should use the name of the sidebar item, the link should be the link to the specific section. For example: *Go to the [Industry](https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/industry/steel) section to change the production routes for steel production*. Do not refer to ETM slides with arrows, for example: *Go to Demand > Industry > Steel*. 
* Documentation: when referring to documentation in text in the ETM, the text could contain the word 'documentation' (but not mandatory). When writing text for documentation and if you want to refer to another page or section in the documentation, use the sidebar title or the title of the specific section as linked text. The link could either the link to the sidebar item or to a specific section of a documentation page. Example when referring to the docs in the ETM: *Read more about how hydrogen is modelled in the ETM in the [documentation](../main/hydrogen.md)*. Example when referring to a different docs section within the docs: *See [Hydrogen production](../main/hydrogen.md#hydrogen-production) for more information about hydrogen producer types modelled in the ETM*. 
* Other references: in other situations, one can make use of the word 'here' or a word that makes sense in the context of the sentence, that will be linked. For example: *The source of electric vehicle profiles from Elaad can be found [here](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2200)*.
