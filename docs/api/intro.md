## Versioning

The ETM API is versioned as **v3**, but at the time of writing is not semantically versioned. While we seek not to change the public API in a way that would break clients, it's nonetheless constantly in development.

All paths to the API are prefixed with `/api/v3`.

## Environments

We operate two versions of the ETM. You should almost always use the production environment unless you have a specific reason to use staging.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Environment</th><th>Endpoint</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Production</td>
      <td><code>engine.energytransitionmodel.com/api/v3</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>staging</td>
      <td><code>beta.engine.energytransitionmodel.com/api/v3</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Production

This is the standard version of the ETM. Features area generally complete, well-tested, and ready to be used by the general public. We aim for the production environment to be available 24-hours a day and 365-days a year, except during occasional, short periods while we perform updates.

We intend to store [protected scenarios](scenario-basics.md#protected-scenarios) created on the production server forever.

#### Staging

The staging environment is used to test new features before they are ready for the general public. While this means you can get access to access to cutting-edge features earlier, results from the staging server are subject to change. Scenarios made on the staging environment cannot be transfered to production, and vice-versa. We do not promise to store scenarios made

We have no plans to delete scenarios from the staging server, we reserve the right to do so, including [protected scenarios](scenario-basics.md#protected-scenarios).

The staging environment may occasionally be unavailable.

## Response status codes

As a REST API, the Energy Transition Model uses a range of status codes to indicate the success or failure of the request.

| Code | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `200 OK` | The request was successful. |
| `201 Created` | The request was successful and a new resource was created. Note that a number of API endpoints use `200 OK` instead. |
| `400 Bad Request` | The server was not able to process the request due to it being malformed. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | The request was rejected due to not having permission to access the resource. |
| `404 Not Found` | The resource requested does not exist at the current time. |
| `406 Not Acceptable` | The `Accept` header did not specify a content type which can be generated by the server. |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | The request was correctly formed (unlike a 400 Bad Request response), but contained errors which prevent it from being accepted. Typically an `"errors"` parameter will contain more information. See [Errors](#errors).
| `429 Too Many Requests` | The request was rejected due to exceeding the API rate-limit. At the time of writing, the ETM has no rate-limits; while there are no plans to change this, but your application should be prepared. |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | An error occurred with the ETM. |

## Errors

Many endpoints within the ETM will respond with useful error information if the received request could not be processed. This will be in the form of a `400..499` response code, and a JSON response containing an `errors` key.

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

{
  "errors": [
    "Curve must have 8760 numeric values, one for each hour in a typical year",
    "Curve must only contain numeric values"
  ]
}
```

:::warning "error_keys" attribute
Some endpoints also provide an `error_keys` attribute â€“ used for localization on official ETM websites. This attribute is not considered stable, and may be subject to change in the future. Please do not rely on it in your own applications.
