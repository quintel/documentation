import endpointData from '@site/data/api/areas';
import ApiEndpoint from '@site/src/components/ApiEndpoint';

The ETM models several hundred regions, ranging from small neighbourhoods up to entire countries.

## The Area object

Endpoints which provide data about an area will return the following information:

* `area` - the unique key for the area.
* `group` - indicates the type of area, for example country, municipality, neighbourhood.
* `analysis_year` - indicates the year used as the base for all data in the area, shown in the ETM as the start year.
* `useable` - true if new scenarios can be created for this dataset through the ETM front-end. You may create scenarios through the API even when this is false.

The area data contains many other attributes, such as the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the region in 1990, the number of households and cars, kilometers of coastline, the land area, and the ETM features supported in the area.

## Get all areas

Fetches a listing of all areas supported by the Energy Transition Model. To get the data for a single area, see the [Get data for an area](#get-data-for-an-area) endpoint.
