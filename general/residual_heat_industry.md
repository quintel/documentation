# Industrial residual heat

There's a lot of heat available in industry that currently goes to waste. Using this residual heat as a source for heat networks could be an interesting way to reduce emissions. In the ETM it is now possible to re-use residual heat from the sectors below:

-   Chemical industry
-   Refineries
-   Fertilizer industry
-   ICT

The above sectors are chosen because of their high residual heat potential compared to other sectors and/or because these sectors are similarly modelled in the ETM.

User can choose with [sliders](https://beta-pro.energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/heat/heat-sources) what part of available heat they want to re-use in heat networks.

## Determinig available residual heat 

### Chemical industry, refineries and fertilizer industry

The available residual heat from chemical industry, refineries and fertilizer industry is determined for each region based on the report [PotentiÃ«len, besparing, alternatieven (ECN, 2011)](https://publicaties.ecn.nl/ECN-E--11-058). In this report for different sectors the residual heat availability is depicted.

Several types of residual heat are distinguished in the report. We have chosen to only model two types in the ETM: heat from flue gasses and heat from processes.

### ICT

The potential of residual heat from datacenters is calculated with the same method that [Berenschot](https://www.berenschot.nl/actueel/2018/november/410-kton-co2-besparing/) used determining the residual heat potential of Dutch datacenters.

## Modelling principals

Residual heat in the ETM originates from the useful demand nodes. The demand of the 'useful demand' nodes for each industry sub sector gives a good approximation of the available residual heat that currently goes 'unused'. This useful demand may change in the future, depending on the user's choices in a scenario regarding industry size, efficiencies etc. Based on the reports above we have determined potential shares of residual heat (the calculation can be found [here](https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2108))
