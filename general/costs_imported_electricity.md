# **Costs of imported electricity**

## **Introduction**
When a country or region has a (temporal) higher electricity demand than production electricity needs to be imported from neighbouring countries or regions. 

The imported electricity has also created costs in this neighbouring country or region. 


## **Default settings**

The default setting for the costs of imported electricity is the average costs of Central West European (CWE) electricity mix: 35 €/MWh or 3.5 ct/KWh. This is a rough estimate from the Quarterly Report on European Electricity Markets
(<a href="#ref">European Commission, 2016</a>). 


The reason to choose the CWE average of 2015 is that most datasets of the ETM are 2015 datasets and that the electricity market is a European market. Also the market prices fluctuate a lot, however the do seem to average around 35 €/MWh in 2015. In the ETM the user can overwrite this default setting for the future situation.
