On the Costs tab of the ETM a user can input all his estimates concerning future energy costs. A graph on the right displays how various types of electricity generation differ in terms of costs. For some of these plants, expert predictions of cost development are included. The user can choose whether the ETM should use these or not. The following categories are available:
* Combustion plants
* Nuclear plants
* Wind turbines
* Hydro electric
* Solar power
* CO<sub>2</sub> emissions

== Assumptions ==
* All costs are excluding taxes or subsidies.
* All costs are in 2010 euros where possible. Some may still be in 2009 euros if we have not had a chance to update the numbers. 
* Nuclear power plant and wind turbine investment costs are including dismantling costs, which are taken as part of the overnight investment costs

Note that if no slider is shown on the Costs tab in the 'advanced view' of the ETM, no assumption about costs are made.

== Combustion plants ==
Although this part is mainly about electricity plants, assumptions can also be made here about future prices of fossil fuels like natural gas, coal and mineral oil. Users can also input assumptions about how investment and operations and maintenance costs of such plants will change in the future.
For some of these plants, expert predictions of cost development are included. The user can choose whether the ETM should use these or not.

== Nuclear plants ==
Just like the Combustion plants side-tab, this concerns costs for electricity production as well as fuel costs. 

== Wind turbines ==
When applicable the ETM distinguishes onshore and offshore wind turbines. The latter are technologically different from the former as conditions for operation and maintenance differ.

== Hydro electric ==
When applicable the ETM distinguishes large hydro electric facilities in mountains, smaller ones located on rivers and also an experimental 'blue energy' plant, which uses the mixing of fresh and salt water to generate energy,

== Solar power ==
The model (when applicable) distinguishes photovoltaic and concentrated thermal solar electricity.

== CO<sub>2</sub> emissions ==
The costs associated with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be estimated.
