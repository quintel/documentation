* Stable versions introduced. It is now possible to access stable environments for stable results. More on accessing these stable API endpoints [can be found here.](intro.md#environments)
* The introduction of stable versions also means that [saved scenarios](saved-scenarios.md) and [collections](collections.md) have version tags associated with them now. These are included in the API responses.
* The saved scenario API response now includes a saved_scenario_users field. [Learn more here.](saved-scenarios.md)
