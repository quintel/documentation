* The scenario `protected` attribute is deprecated and has been split into two separate attributes: [`read_only`](scenarios#read-only-scenarios) and [`keep_compatible`](scenarios.md#forward-compatibility). The `protected` attribute continues to be supported as an alias of `read_only`, and scenarios marked as `protected` will behave as they did before.
