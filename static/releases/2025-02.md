### New features

* New setup of the "My Scenarios" and "My Account" pages
  * A central environment is introduced to manage saved scenarios, Collections, and account settings
  * Use this to:
    * Manage and share saved scenarios
    * Generate Personal Access Tokens
    * Subscribe to the newsletter
    * Update personal infomation
* The "Transition Path Charts" or "Multi Year Charts" tool is renamed to "Collections"
  * The prefix in the URL has been changed from `myc` to `collections`
  * A "Collection" is a set of saved scenarios that can be created in "My Scenarios"
  * A "Transition Path" is a type of "Collection", where a single saved scenario is interpolated to intermediate years
* New charts added to the chart selection:
  * ‘Electricity supply and demand’
  * ‘Network gas supply and demand’
* Improvements for non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to better facilitate the comparison between 1990, the start, and future year:
  * Split of non-energetic and delayed emissions in the ‘CO<sub>2</sub> emissions’ chart to separate categories
  * Update in ‘CO<sub>2</sub> emissions’ chart description regarding non-energetic emissions
  * Update of documentation regarding non-energetic emissions in <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-1990-emissions" target="_blank">1990</a> and those <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-overview-per-sector#emissions-per-sector" target="_blank">modelled in the ETM</a>
* Climate and Energy Outlook (*Klimaat- en Energieverkenning, KEV*) 2024 added as featured scenario for future year <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/saved_scenarios/18836" target="_blank">2030</a> en <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/saved_scenarios/19310" target="_blank">2035</a>
* Start year data improvements for the municipality of Emmen, regarding the chemical and other industry sectors
* Update of the dataset of Antwerp from to start year 2022
* Further improvements to our automatic testing suite that checks the model’s calculations

### Bug fixes

  * Fixed a minor discrepancy between the calculated hourly and annual electricity flows for load shifting in the ICT sector
  * Added missing technology hybrid air heat pump (oil-fired) to chart ‘Number of residences per space heating technology’
  * Added missing natural gas export hourly demand profile to the data-export 'Network gas demand, production and storage per hour'
  * Correction in biomass to heat flow in ‘Energy flow overview’ (Sankey) chart to avoid double counting of green gas flows
  * Redesign of chart ‘Net flow of refinery products’ to visualize transformation of non-oil energy carriers when coupled to an external industry model
  * Fixed behaviour of external coupling for must-run interconnectors
  * Minor correction in aviation emissions in municipal datasets
  * Fix in Collections to correct for double-counting of green gas in final demand series
  * Correction in chart 'Total greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 eq)' to ensure that depicted CO2 emissions are aligned with 'CO2 emissions' chart
