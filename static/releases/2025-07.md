### New features

**New tables available to explore economic viability**

The ETM now includes three new economic viability tables that provide comprehensive cost-benefit analyses for electricity production, storage, and flexible demand technologies. The tables enable users to gain a first insight in the cost effectiveness of these assets. The tables can be found in the "Cost" section of the charts selection. See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/economic-viability" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.
