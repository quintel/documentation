### New features

* The modelling of solar PV has been improved:
  * New sliders to set the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/temperature-and-full-load-hours" target="_blank">full load hours</a> separately for solar rooftop (households), solar rooftop (buildings), solar on land and solar offshore.
  * Updated default hourly profiles of solar PV technologies for the European datasets in the ETM, based on the <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-energy-pecd?tab=overview" target="_blank">Pan European Climate Database (PECD)</a>. Go to the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a> to find this data for a specific dataset.
  * The default hourly profiles can be overwritten by uploading custom profiles in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">Flexibility</a> section of the model.
* The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/overview/scenario_overview/overview" target="_blank">scenario landing page</a> has been changed from a generic introduction to working with the ETM to a scenario dashboard.
* The output products of a selection of processes for <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/fuel_production/overview" target="_blank">liquid fuels production</a> have been updated to match existing standards.
* The start year data for <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/datasets/UKNI01" target="_blank">Northern Ireland</a> has been revised and updated.

### Bug fixes

* Unused surplus heat production in <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/heat/overview-district-heating" target="_blank">district heating networks</a>, the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/industry/steam-network-sources" target="_blank">industrial steam network</a> and from <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat-from-local-chps" target="_blank">local CHPs in agriculture</a>, were previously allocated to the final energy demand of their respective sectors. This has been changed so that unused heat is no longer part of final energy demand but is considered as a loss. This may have changed final energy demand in existing scenarios.
* The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/data/data_export/overview" target="_blank">data exports</a> sometimes showed error messages when exporting curves of private scenarios. This has been fixed.
* There was a bug in sliders that set the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/costs/specs_electricity/coal-plants" target="_blank">efficiency of power plants</a>, resulting in an overestimation of electricity production. This bug has been resolved.
* There was some faulty behaviour in scenario collaboration which has been resolved. Go to <a href="https://my.energytransitionmodel.com/saved_scenarios" target="_blank">MyETM</a> to start collaborating on scenarios.
* Various other improvements and minor bug fixes have been made.
