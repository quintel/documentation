### New features

* Various improvements have been made in the modelling of solar PV technologies, consisting of:
  * New sliders to set the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/temperature-and-full-load-hours" target="_blank">full load hours</a> separately for solar on roof (households), solar on roof (buildings), solar on land and solar offshore.
  * Updated default hourly profiles of solar PV technologies for the European datasets in the ETM, based on the <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/sis-energy-pecd?tab=overview" target="_blank">Pan European Climate Database (PECD)</a>. Go to the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a> to find this data for a specific dataset.
  * The default hourly profiles can be overwritten by uploading custom profiles in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">Flexibility</a> section of the model. 
* The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/overview/scenario_overview/overview" target="_blank">overview</a> when opening a new or existing scenario has been renewed: it now functions better as a dashboard of scenario results that relate to the different sections of the ETM.
* The output products of various processes for <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/fuel_production/overview" target="_blank">liquid fuels production</a> have been improved to better align with products that will emain relevant in the future.
* The <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/datasets/UKNI01" target="_blank">Northern Ireland dataset</a> has been revised and updated for start year 2018. 

### Bug fixes

* There was an issue which caused unused surplus heat production in <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/heat/overview-district-heating" target="_blank">district heating networks</a>, in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/industry/steam-network-sources" target="_blank">industrial steam network</a> and from <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat-from-local-chps" target="_blank">local CHPs in agriculture</a> to be allocated to final demand. This has been fixed so that unused heat is now considered as loss instead. This fix may have resulted in changes in existing scenarios.
* Small fixes have been applied to various default hourly profiles of the Netherlands dataset with start year 2023 and of the European datasets. These fixes may have led to minor changes in existing scenarios. 
* There was a bug in sliders that set the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/costs/specs_electricity/coal-plants" target="_blank">efficiency of power plants</a>, resulting in incorrect calculations of related parameters. This bug has been resolved. 
* A bug has been fixed that led to incorrect calculation of the share of non-biogenic and biogenic waste in the waste mix in a few charts. These shares are now calculated correctly again. 
* There was some faulty behaviour in scenario collaboration which has been resolved. Collabaroting on scenarios should work normally again. Go to <a href="https://my.energytransitionmodel.com/saved_scenarios" target="_blank">MyETM</a> to start collaborating on scenarios.
