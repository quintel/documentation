### New features

* Bio-LNG can now be used as a transport fuel in <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/transport_fuels/international-navigation" target="_blank">international navigation</a> (maritime bunkers) by setting the share of bio-LNG in the LNG mix for vessels.
* The flow chart 'Future biomass flows' has been renewed to better represent the bio footprint of a region. The chart shows the flows of the standard energy balance biogenic carriers to conversion, final demand and export.
* Offshore wind turbines with electrolysers, for dedicated <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production" target="_blank">hydrogen production</a>, used to have a separate slider to set the full load hours. This is no longer the case: there is now a single <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/temperature-and-full-load-hours" target="_blank">full load hours</a> slider for all offshore wind turbines. Uploading a <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">custom profile</a> for offshore wind now also applies to offshore wind with electrolysers. These changes may have affected results of existing scenarios.
* The full load hours of LH2 regasification and LOHC reforming have been updated to be aligned with those of ammonia reformers. Go to the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production" target="_blank">hydrogen </a> section to see the technical and financial specifications of these technologies. If installed capacity for these technologies was set in existing scenarios, the values were corrected to maintain the same hydrogen production volume.
* New functionalities have been added to PyETM, the standard Python package for communicating with the API of the ETM, such as: scenario interpolation, copying scenarios and setting user roles. The renewed version is now available as a pre-release on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyetm/2.0.0b3" target="_blank">PyPI</a>.
* The data-export `applications_demand.csv` has been retired because it was no longer consistent with other model calculations. Please get in touch if this data-export was used in an existing workflow.

### Bug fixes

* There was an issue in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/electricity_import_export/interconnector-1" target="_blank">interconnectors</a> section that prevented loading electricity price curves from a saved scenario through the front-end interface. This has now been resolved.
* Some corrections were done in the start year data of municipality <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/datasets/GM1979" target="_blank">Eemsdelta</a>. Existing scenarios created for this region may have been affected.
