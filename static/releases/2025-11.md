### New features

**Liquid fuels improvements**

The modelling of liquid fuels production and consumption has been improved by adding new production processes and expanding final demand sectors.

This improvement includes various new features and changes, among others:

* A new section <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/fuel_production/overview" target="_blank">Liquid fuels and feedstock</a> has been added, containing existing and new processes for liquid fuels production. Go to the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/liquid-fuels" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.
* The following energy carriers have been added to the model: bionaphtha, biomethanol, pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis bio-oil.
* Final demand in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/industry/chemicals" target="_blank">chemical industry</a>, <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/transport_freight_transport/domestic-navigation-technology" target="_blank">national</a> and <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com//scenario/demand/transport_international_transport/international-navigation-technology" target="_blank">international</a> transport has been expanded with existing and new energy carriers.
* Improvements have been made in the calculation of primary demand for biogenic carriers. This may have resulted in changes to existing scenarios.
* The existing <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/fuel_production/oil-refineries" target="_blank">Oil refineries</a> and <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_fuels/road-transport" target="_blank">Transport fuels</a> sections have been relocated in the model to be better fit their role in the energy system.

**Other new features**

* The hourly availability of the power-to-heat technologies for district heating in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-heat-for-district-heating" target="_blank">Flexibility</a> section is now temperature-dependent. Go to the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/electricity-conversion/#district-heating-network" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.
* PyETM is the standard Python package used to connect to the API of the ETM. A completely renewed version is now available as a pre-release on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyetm/2.0.0b0/" target="_blank">PyPI</a>.
* Various improvements in user experience have been made, such as automatic chart rescaling in <a href="https://collections.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Collections</a> when switching units and enhanced functionality for editing <a href="https://my.energytransitionmodel.com/collections" target="_blank">scenario collections</a> in MyETM.

### Bug fixes

  * The hourly profiles in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/data/data_export/hourly-curves-for-heat-in-the-built-environment" target="_blank">data exports</a> for heat in the built environment started on the 1st of April. They have been corrected to start at the 1st of January.
  * There was an error in the biomass potentials in the start year data of regional Dutch datasets. This error has been rectified; the datasets now contain the correct biomass potentials. Consult the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a> to view the potentials for a specific region.
  * The datasets of Norway and Serbia contained incorrect values for aluminium production in the start year. These values have been updated. Consult the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a> to see the country-specific values.
  * For some regional Dutch datasets, a bug has been solved in the hourly profiles. Similar to the other regional datasets, the hourly profiles are now based on the national dataset.
